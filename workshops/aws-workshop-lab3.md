# Lab 3 - Davis AI

## Lab 3 - Problems

Often the monitoring tools organizations use simply don‚Äôt work in the complex ecosystem of microservices and for technologies like Kubernetes.

Finding the root cause of problems is harder than ever before and the effort required goes beyond what is humanly possible when the application spans to the cloud providers and data centers and the explosion of interconnected services. There are more possibilities for failures and more hiding spots for problems to sneak into the environment when software driving more than just the application.

In this lab, we will trigger a few problem and see how troubleshooting time is significantly reduced by letting AI automatically detect problems and pinpoints the root cause, explaining business impact with no manual configurations.

### Objectives of this Lab

üî∑ Enable a problem in the application and walk through what [Dynatrace Davis](https://www.dynatrace.com/platform/artificial-intelligence/) found


## Enable application problems
---------------------------

The Dynatrace Orders sample application has pre-built problems with
different versions.

These problems can be enabled with a `setversion` URL that can be used
to change the version and thus the behavior of the application. Version
1 is the **"normal"** behavior and problems are enabled by setting the
version to a value such as 2 or 3.

In the next section, you will run a unix script that sets these
problems.

### Monolith deployment - backend service - High Response time for all requests
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Dynatrace Events

Before we get to the problems, let's review Refer to
<a href="https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/dynatrace-api/environment-api/events/post-event/" target="_blank">Dynatrace
information events</a>.

Dynatrace information events enable continuous delivery tools to provide
additional details for Dynatrace. Here is an example of two
informational events for deployment and performance testing being be
sent to Dynatrace.

![image](assets/aws-workshop/lab3-pipeline.png)

There are several Dynatrace information event types: \*
`CUSTOM_ANNOTATION` \* `CUSTOM_CONFIGURATION` \* `CUSTOM_DEPLOYMENT` \*
`CUSTOM_INFO` \* `MARKED_FOR_TERMINATION`

Below we can see both the `CUSTOM_INFO` (\#1) and `CUSTOM_DEPLOYMENT`
events (\#2) for a service that was the root cause to a problem the
Dynatrace AI engine, Davis¬Æ, determined.

![image](assets/aws-workshop/lab3-problemcard-events.png)

Each event has a timestamp, event source, a few standardized fields
(depending on the event type), and the option to add additional custom
fields. See
<a href="https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/api-events-post-event#parameters-mapping" target="_blank">this
table</a> for details. Here are two example events. NOTE the URL back to
the pipeline making the change.

### üëç How this helps
----------------

Having information events speeds up triage by adding context to what's
happening with the application. Just imagine getting alerted about an
issue and immediately seeing a load test or deployment took place, and
in one click of the event, URL review the system, job, and team
responsible!

### Dynatrace tags
--------------

When creating information events, you must target the entities to
receive the event so that it's only associated with the relevant
component. That is where Dynatrace tags come in.

In a nutshell, tags in Dynatrace are labels or markers used for
organizing entities in large monitoring environments. Below shows a few
tags for my catalog service: `stage:staging` and
`service:catalog-service`

### API call Example
----------------

    curl -X POST \
      https://mySampleEnv.live.dynatrace.com/api/v1/events \
      -H 'Authorization: Api-token abcdefjhij1234567890' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \  
      -d '{
      "eventType" : "CUSTOM_DEPLOYMENT",
      "source" : "Pipeline Script" ,
      "deploymentName" : "Set order-service to version 1",
      "deploymentVersion" : "1"  ,
      "deploymentProject" : "dt-orders project" ,

                                "key": "service",
                                  "value": "order-service"
                          },
                              {
                                "context": "CONTEXTLESS",
                                "key": "project",
                                  "value": "dt-orders"
                          },
                              {
                                "context": "CONTEXTLESS",
                                "key": "stage",
                                  "value": "production"
                          }
                ]}
              ]}
            }
    }'

### Backend service problem
-----------------------

Now we are going to set the `backend` service version that will cause
high response time for all backend requests.

To automate the version change, a unix script is provided that will do
the following: \* Call the `backend/setversion` URL set the backend
version \* Send a Dynatrace `CUSTOM_DEPLOYMENT` event indicating the
change

After a minute or so, you should expect to see high Response time for
all requests.

### 1. Enable the problem pattern
-----------------------------

From the AWS CLoudShell, run these commands to set the backend service
to version 2

    cd ~/aws-modernization-dt-orders-setup/learner-scripts/
    ./set-version.sh backend 2

Review the output to ensure the change was made successfully. I should
look like this with numerical values at the end for Response Data:
`storedEventIds:`

    Response Data
    {"storedEventIds":[8663164135574257870,-5988376401319068441],"storedIds":["8663164135574257870_1628095127627","-5988376401319068441_1628095127627"],"storedCorrelationIds":[]}

### 2. View app in browser
----------------------

The event has the URL back to the sample application, so just click that
if you don't have the sample app up already. You should see `version 2`
for the customer app now too.

![image](assets/aws-workshop/lab3-app-backend-version-2.png)

### 3. Review problem in Dynatrace
------------------------------

The problem may take a minute to show up, but this is what the problem
will look like once it does. Also, you may see two problems that
eventually get merged into one as Dynatrace is performing the problem
analysis.

1.  Impact Summary - Multiple services affected
2.  Root cause

![image](assets/aws-workshop/lab3-backend-problem.png)

### 4. Analyze problem - top findings
---------------------------------

Click on the `Analyze Response Time Degradation` button to view the real
issue with the request. To open the top findings page.

Here you can see how Dynatrace automatically analyzes the problem and
lets you know whether the problem is related to code, waiting, or other
services and queues.

Click in the `active wait time` line with the top findings to open the
execution time breakdown detail.

![image](assets/aws-workshop/lab3-backend-analysis.png)

### 5. Analyze problem - execution time breakdown
---------------------------------------------

Dynatrace automatically show the breakdown of the execution time. To see
more, click the `View method hotspots` button.

![image](assets/aws-workshop/lab3-backend-hotspots.png)

### 6. Analyze problem - hot spots
------------------------------

Here the code call breakdown is shown and by expanding this tree, you
can locate the method where the slow down is occurring. **NOTE: You will
need to expand several stack frames to get to method causing the slow
down.**

![image](assets/aws-workshop/lab3-backend-analysis-trace.png)

### 7. Analyze problem impact
-------------------------

From the breadcrumb menu, click on the `backend` to open the service
page.

![image](assets/aws-workshop/lab3-backend-breadcrumb.png)

Then click on the response time box to open the service details page.
You can see exactly when the problem started.

![image](assets/aws-workshop/lab3-backend-problem-details.png)

### 8. Disable the problem pattern
------------------------------

Run these commands to set the backend to version 1

    cd ~/aws-modernization-dt-orders-setup/learner-scripts/
    ./set-version.sh backend 1

üí• **TECHNICAL NOTE**

**Why does the problem card say 'Custom Threshold'?**

The Dynatrace AI engine is evaluating metrics and dependencies for daily
and weekly traffic patterns. Since we just setup our sample application,
there is not a lot of history to review we setup a fixed threshold as a
global service setting.

To review this setting, on the left side menu, click `settings`, click
`Anomaly Detection` and the the `Services` setting.

![image](assets/aws-workshop/lab3-global-anomoly-rules.png)

Learn more about how How problems are detected and analyzed in the
<a href="https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/how-to-use-dynatrace/problem-detection-and-analysis/problem-detection/automated-multi-dimensional-baselining/" target="_blank">Dynatrace
Docs</a>

## Order service problem
---------------------

Now we are going to set the `order` service version that will cause
failures on the all requests.

To automate the version change, a unix script is provided that will do
the following: \* Call the `order/setversion` URL set the order-service
version \* Send a Dynatrace `CUSTOM_DEPLOYMENT` event indicating the
change

After a minute or so, you should expect to see exceptions for all order
related requests.

![image](assets/aws-workshop/lab3-order-problem-usecase.png)

### 1. Enable the problem pattern
-----------------------------

Then from the `Services` host shell, run these commands to set the order
service to version 3.

    cd ~/aws-modernization-dt-orders-setup/learner-scripts/
    ./set-version.sh k8-order 3

Ensure there are numerical values at the end for Response Data:
`storedEventIds` like:

    Response Data
    {"storedEventIds":[8663164135574257870,-5988376401319068441],"storedIds":["8663164135574257870_1628095127627","-5988376401319068441_1628095127627"],"storedCorrelationIds":[]}

### 2. View change in Dynatrace
---------------------------

From the left side menu, navigate to the `Releases` page. Here you will
see the how Dynatrace detected the versions of monitored processes. It
may take a minute, but you will see the version change in the
`Real-time inventory` section and a new event in the `Release events`
section.

**NOTE** Be sure to adjust the management zone to `dt-orders-services`

![image](assets/aws-workshop/lab3-release-order.png)

If you expand the event, you should see something like this

![image](assets/aws-workshop/lab3-release-order-event.png)

### 3. View app in browser
----------------------

The event has the URL back to the sample application, so just click that
if you don't have the sample app up already. You should see `version 3`
for the order app now too.

![image](assets/aws-workshop/lab3-app-ui-order-version-3.png)

### 4. Review problem in Dynatrace
------------------------------

The problem may take a minute to show up, but this is what the problem
will look like once it does. Also, you may see two problems that
eventually get merged into one as Dynatrace is performing the problem
analysis.

1.  Problem card windows and impact summary
2.  Root cause
3.  Deployment event as additional context

![image](assets/aws-workshop/lab3-order-problem.png)

### 5. Analyze problem
------------------

Referring to \#4 in the picture above, click on the
`Analyze failure rate degradation` button.

Right away we can see that there were exceptions in the code and the
`details` button can be clicked to see the code stack trace.

![image](assets/aws-workshop/lab3-order-problem-detail.png)

### 6. Analyze problem impact
-------------------------

From the breadcrumb menu, click on the `order` to open the service page.

![image](assets/aws-workshop/lab3-order-menu.png)

On this page, notice the failure rate.

![image](assets/aws-workshop/lab3-order-problem-service.png)

Then click on the failure rate box to open the service details page. You
can see exactly when the problem started.

![image](assets/aws-workshop/lab3-order-problem-requests.png)

### 7. Disable the problem pattern
------------------------------

From the from the `Services` host shell, run these commands to set the
version back to version 1

    cd ~/aws-modernization-dt-orders-setup/learner-scripts/
    ./set-version.sh k8-order 1

Dynatrace will automatically close the problem once it detects things
are back to normal.
