**Infrastructure Monitoring** 
- Dynatrace delivers simplified, automated infrastructure monitoring that provides broad visibility across your hosts, VMs, containers, network, events, and logs. Dynatrace continuously auto-discovers your dynamic environment and pulls infrastructure metrics into our Davis® AI engine, so you can consolidate tools and cut MTTI.

**Applications and Microservices** 
- Dynatrace provides automated, code-level visibility and root-cause answers for applications that span complex enterprise cloud environments. Dynatrace automatically captures timing and code-level context for transactions across every tier. It also detects and monitors microservices automatically across the entire hybrid cloud, from mobile to mainframe.

**Digital Experience Monitoring (DEM)** 
- Dynatrace DEM provides Real User Monitoring (RUM) for every one of your customer's journeys, synthetic monitoring across a global network, and 4K movie-like Session Replay. This powerful combination helps you optimize your applications, improve user experience, and provide superior support across all digital channels.

**Digital Business Analytics**
- By tying business metrics and KPIs to data that's already flowing through our application performance and digital experience modules, you get real-time, AI-powered answers to your critical business questions.

**Cloud Automation**
- Dynatrace AIOps gives you precise answers automatically. Dynatrace collects high-fidelity data and maps dependencies in real-time so that the Dynatrace explainable AI engine, Davis®, can show you the precise root causes of problems or anomalies, enabling quick auto-remediation and intelligent cloud orchestration.

The above use cases are setup as labs which you can run through:
* [Digital Experience Management with Dynatrace](/workshops/dem)
* [Advanced Observability with Dynatrace](/workshops/advanced-observability)
* [BizOps with Dynatrace](/workshops/bizops)
* [Autonomous Cloud with Dynatrace](/workshops/autonomous-cloud)

These are also conducted virtually as [Hands-On Workshops](/schedule).
