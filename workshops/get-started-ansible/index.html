<p>This section contains the various approaches to get started with Redhat Ansible. This includes the various flavors of Ansible including Redhat Ansible Tower.</p>

<google-codelab-step label="Automated Deployment with Ansible" duration="15">
<p>In this exercise, we will deploy the OneAgent to a Linux instance with Ansible.</p>
<p>Based off our <a href="https://github.com/Dynatrace/Dynatrace-OneAgent-Ansible" target="_blank">Dynatrace Ansible Github</a>, you can rollout Dynatrace Oneagent easily across on Linux and Windows Operating Systems with different available configurations and ensures the OneAgent service maintains a running state. It also provides the tasks to interact with the various OneAgent configuration files.</p>
<p>Following the steps from our <a href="https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/setup-and-configuration/dynatrace-oneagent/deployment-orchestration/ansible/" target="_blank">documentation</a>, we will use an Ansible collection to orchestrate OneAgent deployment.</p>
<p>You can also use other Ansible playbooks examples can be seen <a href="https://github.com/popecruzdt/dt-ansible/blob/popecruzdt/dt-oneagent-install-linux.yml" target="_blank">here</a></p>

<google-codelab-step label="Self Healing with Ansible" duration="15">
<p>Deploying applications efficiently requires using an <strong>automated delivery pipeline</strong>. Dynatrace tracks all key metrics through the various CI/CD stages into production. Through understanding the feedback loop, you can stop faulty builds before they reach production or even self-remediate issues based on problems which Dynatrace detects. This allows deploying software faster with higher quality.</p>
<p>There are various kinds of use cases for Ansible playbooks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deployment change</li>
<li>Rollback change</li>
<li>Rollback deployment</li>
<li>Auto remediation</li>
</ul>
<p>Example of these playbooks could be found <a href="https://github.com/Dynatrace-APAC/dt-ansible-autoremediation" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<aside class="special"><p>This systematic and generic approach can be applied to any software that Dynatrace monitors and any CI/CD pipeline that our customers may use, meaning we can speed up ðŸš€ their delivery up to 80% while ensuring the functionality and a higher level of quality of their released software âœ….</p>

<google-codelab-step label="Advanced Use Cases" duration="0">
<p>Dynatrace is an all-in-one platform that&#39;s purpose-built for a wide range of use cases.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Deploy" src="img/6bc1ded3f014cf01.png"></p>
<p><strong>Infrastructure Monitoring</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Dynatrace delivers simplified, automated infrastructure monitoring that provides broad visibility across your hosts, VMs, containers, network, events, and logs. Dynatrace continuously auto-discovers your dynamic environment and pulls infrastructure metrics into our DavisÂ® AI engine, so you can consolidate tools and cut MTTI.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Applications and Microservices</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Dynatrace provides automated, code-level visibility and root-cause answers for applications that span complex enterprise cloud environments. Dynatrace automatically captures timing and code-level context for transactions across every tier. It also detects and monitors microservices automatically across the entire hybrid cloud, from mobile to mainframe.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Digital Experience Monitoring (DEM)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Dynatrace DEM provides Real User Monitoring (RUM) for every one of your customer&#39;s journeys, synthetic monitoring across a global network, and 4K movie-like Session Replay. This powerful combination helps you optimize your applications, improve user experience, and provide superior support across all digital channels.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Digital Business Analytics</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>By tying business metrics and KPIs to data that&#39;s already flowing through our application performance and digital experience modules, you get real-time, AI-powered answers to your critical business questions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cloud Automation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Dynatrace AIOps gives you precise answers automatically. Dynatrace collects high-fidelity data and maps dependencies in real-time so that the Dynatrace explainable AI engine, DavisÂ®, can show you the precise root causes of problems or anomalies, enabling quick auto-remediation and intelligent cloud orchestration.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above use cases are setup as labs which you can run through:</p>
