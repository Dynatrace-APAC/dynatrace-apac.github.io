## Deploy Weather Service WebApp
Duration: 10

In this exercise, you will deploy a Azure WebApp web service API that collects weather information of various cities/countries in a JSON format

Technology stack used
- NodeJS
- .NET
- Microsoft managed CosmosDB (hosted in a central location, outside of your Azure subscription)

> Note: **publish.ps1** is a PowerShell script written to automate the creation of the AppServicePlan, AppService and also to upload the source codes of our application. Depending on your cloud shell location, you may change the **$location** value within the **publish.ps1** to fit your region. **By default**, it is set to **Southeast Asia**. Full list of regions are [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/global-infrastructure/geographies/#geographies)
> 
> Example
> ```powershell
> $location="Southeast Asia"
> ```
> ```powershell
> $location="Australia East"
> ```

### (a) Execute script publish.ps1 to deploy WebApp

Replace the **firstname-lastname** from the below command and adapt that to your own.

`./publish.ps1 firstname-lastname-dynatrace firstname-lastname-weather-service`

**Example**
```powershell
./publish.ps1 brandon-neo-dynatrace brandon-neo-weather-service
```

Enter **Y** when prompted to deploy the content of the Weather Service app (**partner-azure/weather-service/weather-service-app.zip**)

![Azure-shell](assets/bootcamp/azure/azure-shell-yes.png)

### (b) Verify Resource Group creation

Now that your app has been deployed, verify that the resource group has been deployed as well.
- Go to the Azure Portal > Resource Groups > **firstname-lastname-weather-service** (select the ***App Service*** one)
- Click on the link under the section Overview > Essentials > URL
  ![Azure-shell](assets/bootcamp/azure/weather-service.gif)

- Append `/weather/current/Linz` to your URL from your **firstname-lastname-weather-service** App Service

**Example**

**https://brandon-neo-weather-service.azurewebsites.net/weather/current/Linz**

You should get a page reflecting JSON results.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Automated observability with Dynatrace
Duration: 5

### (a) Validating technology stacks
Once Dynatrace has been deployed, the OneAgent will start collecting data. It is advisible to validate if the data collected accurately represents the environment. It is not suffucent to simply check for services or purepaths. 
- Access Dynatrace UI, left hand menu > **Technology**
- As you can see, Dynatrace automatically detects both ASP.NET and the NodeJS components
  ![Dynatrace-weather-service](assets/bootcamp/azure/Dynatrace-weather-service-tech.png)
- Go to **Transactions and Services**, you should see 4 services, 2 are of the .NET technology and another 2, the NodeJS technology 
  ![Dynatrace-weather-service](assets/bootcamp/azure/Dynatrace-weather-service-serviceview.png)
  
Negative
: Can you tell the relationship between the .NET and NodeJS services?
 
Negative
: How do you see graphically which service calls which service?

### (b) Investigate the PurePaths
- Deep dive into some of the PurePaths
  ![Dynatrace-weather-service](assets/bootcamp/azure/Dynatrace-weather-service-pp.png)

Negative
: What do you notice of the response times of some of the transactions?
 
Negative
: What other components were called?
 
Negative
: Did you have to do manually instrument the app or do any coding to get this visibility?

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Deploy Weather Express Web App - A Web UI over the weather-restify api
Duration: 5

### (a) Deploy Weather Express WebApp

In this exercise, you will deploy a Azure WebApp web service that renders a Web UI and provides an interactive interface to display weather information.

Technology stack used
- NodeJS
- .NET
- Redis cache (hosted in a central location, outside of your Azure subscription)

Change folder to **weather-express** folder with `cd ../weather-express` command

> Note: Similar to the previous step, you may change the **$location** value within the **publish.ps1** to fit your region. **By default**, it is set to **Southeast Asia**. Full list of regions are [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/global-infrastructure/geographies/#geographies)

### (b) Execute script publish.ps1 to deploy WebApp

Replace the **firstname-lastname** from the below command and adapt that to your own.

`./publish.ps1 firstname-lastname-dynatrace firstname-lastname-weather-express`

Negative
: Do note that the naming is weather-**express**

**Example**
```powershell
./publish.ps1 brandon-neo-dynatrace brandon-neo-weather-express
```

Enter **Y** when prompted to deploy the content of the Weather Service app (**partner-azure/weather-service/weather-express-app.zip**)

### (c) Verify Resource Group creation

Similar to the **Weather Service App** verfication, check on the **Weather Express App** App Service URL.
- Go to the Azure Portal > Resource Groups > **firstname-lastname-weather-express** (select the ***App Service*** one)
- Click on the link under the section Overview > Essentials > URL
  ![Weather-Express](assets/bootcamp/azure/weather-express.gif)
- In the Weather Express web UI, click on **"Current weather in Linz"** and after which **"Current weather in Gdansk"**
  ![Weather-Express](assets/bootcamp/azure/weather-express-currweather.png)

Negative
: What is the error that you observed?

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Instrumenting Weather-Express to diagnose the error
Duration: 5

Similar to instrumenting the Weather-Service WebApp, use the Azure site extensions with the previously copied PaaS token, environment ID and Server URL

### Install Dynatrace OneAgent site extension via Azure Portal

![Deployment-site-extension](assets/bootcamp/azure/deployment-site-extension.gif)

- After installation is complete, go to Azure Portal and **restart** the App Service application to recycle the application's worker process
  ![Restart](assets/bootcamp/azure/webapp-restart.png)
- Access the webapp's URL again and fire a few transactions

Positive

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Automated observability for Weather-Express
Duration: 5

### (a) Validating technology stacks
- Go to **Transactions and Services**, investigate the **weather-express** services 
  ![Dynatrace-weather-express](assets/bootcamp/azure/Dynatrace-weather-express-serviceview.png)
  
Negative
: What services were detected for weather-**express**? Do you think there are any missing services?

### (b) Investigate the PurePaths
- Deep dive into some of the PurePaths, especially those purepaths with the URL **/current**
  ![Dynatrace-weather-express](assets/bootcamp/azure/Dynatrace-weather-express-pp.gif)

Negative
: Do you notice that some purepaths have errors?
 
Negative
: What is displayed when drilling down into the purepaths?
 
Negative
: Is there enough visibility to diagnose the error?

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Solving the mystery of the missing services
Duration: 5

The OneAgents have a specific requirement when it comes to supportability of NodeJS versions and bitness. In the [documentation](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/supported-technologies#nodejs), it is mentioned that only ***64-bit*** NodeJS versions are supported.

However, when creating the Azure WebApp, it defaults to 32-bits, as seen in this configuration screen:

![32-bits](assets/bootcamp/azure/weather-expressconfig.png)

### Enabling 64-bits NodeJS for Azure WebApps via Azure Portal
- In Azure Portal, go to the Weather-**Express** ***App Service***
- In the left menu, scroll down to **Settings** > **Configuration** > **General Settings**
- Let's change this to 64-bits
  ![Azure-appservice-config](assets/bootcamp/azure/appserviceconfig1.gif)
- Another configuration is required, under **Application settings** tab (next to General Settings), look for `WEBSITE_NODE_DEFAULT_VERSION`
- Edit that line and set the value to `~10`
  > `WEBSITE_NODE_DEFAULT_VERSION = ~10`
  
  ![Azure-appservice-config](assets/bootcamp/azure/appserviceconfig2.gif)
- Click on **SAVE** and **restart** the App Service application to recycle the application's worker process
  ![Restart](assets/bootcamp/azure/webapp-restart.png)
- Access the webapp's URL again and fire a few transactions
- You should now be able to see that the NodeJS service has been detected and instrumented
- Click on the **"Current weather in Gdansk"** and change the location in the URL to `/current?loc=Singapore` or `/current?loc=Malaysia`
  ![Weather-Express-NodeJS](assets/bootcamp/azure/Dynatrace-weather-express-nodejs.gif)

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Investigating the Weather-Express issue with Dynatrace
Duration: 5

Access the **/current** purepaths again. Investigate the `/current?loc=Singapore` and/or `/current?loc=Malaysia` and this time, Dynatrace should give you a pretty good idea where the error is coming from

![Weather-ExpressPP](assets/bootcamp/azure/weather-express-pp.gif)

Negative
: What do you think is causing this error?

### (a) Resolution and Verification

In order to resolve this issue, we have to change the code. For Azure WebApps, a built-in Code editor can be used to modify codes.

To access to built-in code editor
- In Azure Portal, go to the Weather-**Express** ***App Service***
- In the left menu, scroll down to **Development Tools** > **App Service Editor (Preview)**
- Click on **Go** and the browser-based editor will open in another tab
  ![AppServiceEditor](assets/bootcamp/azure/AppServiceEditor.gif)

- Under `WWWROOT/config/main.js`, resolve the following based on the GIF
- Renaming your Uri to your **firstname-lastname**-weather-service.azurewebsites.net/weather

  ![Azure-shell](assets/bootcamp/azure/resolve.gif)

- Recycle the App Service again
  ![Restart](assets/bootcamp/azure/webapp-restart.png)

Once you have resolved the issue, the **Weather Express Portal** should be displaying the weather in Linz and any location that you enter.

![Weather-Express](assets/bootcamp/azure/Weather-Express-success.gif)

> Use Dynatrace to explore "Applications", "Transactions and Service", "PurePaths" etc.
> 
> Can you tell how Weather Express and Weather Service are related? Who calls who, and how is it called? Did you have to do complex configuration steps to reach this level of visibility?
> 
> What can you tell about the data collected and how do you think it will help various teams like CloudOps, App Dev teams, Business teams etc.?
