# Dynatrace with Azure
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Introduction 
Duration: 1

This repository contains labs for the Azure Hands-On Session. 

### Prerequisites
- Azure Portal Account access:
  - Bring Your Own Subscription, e.g. Microsoft Visual Studio Subscription
  - Access from [Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/offers/ms-azr-0044p/) 

### What Youâ€™ll Learn 
- How to deploy Web App on Azure
- Learn how to use deploy Dynatrace with Azure with **Site Extensions**
- Using Dynatrace to validate and diagnose issues
- How to deploy Azure Function

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Preparing the environment
Duration: 1

### Clone Repo to Azure Cloud shell

Login to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) with your designated email.

Click on **Cloud Shell icon** on the top navigation bar.

![Azure](assets/bootcamp/azure/azure-shell.png)

Make sure that you have selected **PowerShell** in the left drop-down within Cloud shell.

![Azure](assets/bootcamp/azure/power-shell.png)

Within the Cloudshell terminal, type in the below.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dynatrace-APAC/partner-azure.git
cd partner-azure/weather-service
```

The above command will download the git from the repo into your Cloud bastion host. This is setup based on your **Storage Account** location.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Deploy Weather Service WebApp
Duration: 1

In this exercise, you will deploy a Azure WebApp web service API that collects weather information from various cities/countries.

Technology stack used
- NodeJS
- .NET
- Radis Cache (hosted in a central location, outside of your Azure subscription)

Negative
: Depending on your cloud shell location, you may change the **$location** value within the **publish.p1** to fit your region. Full list of regions are [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/global-infrastructure/geographies/#geographies)

Example
```bash
$location="Southeast Asia"
```
```bash  
$location="Australia East"
```
### Execute script publish.ps1 to deploy WebApp

Replace the **firstname-lastname** from the below command and adapt that to your own.

`./publish.ps1 firstname-lastname-dynatrace firstname-lastname-weather-service`

**Example**

**./publish.ps1 brandon-neo-dynatrace brandon-neo-weather-service**

Enter **Y** when prompted to deploy the content of the Weather Service app (**partner-azure/weather-service/weather-service-app.zip**)

![Azure-shell](assets/bootcamp/azure/azure-shell-yes.png)

### Verify Resource Group creation

Now that your app has been deployed, verify that the resource group has been deployed as well. 

![Azure-shell](assets/bootcamp/azure/weather-service.gif)

Append `/weather/current/Linz` to your URL from your **firstname-lastname-weather-service** App Service

**Example**

**https://brandon-neo-weather-service.azurewebsites.net/weather/current/Linz**

You should get a page reflecting JSON results.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Instrumenting Weather-Service
Duration: 5

### Copy out relevant information via Dynatrace UI
- Create a **PaaS token**, copy it and store is somewhere safe
- As this is a Managed environment, you will need both environment ID and server URL
  Environment ID (in bold)
  `https://mou612.managed-sprint.dynalabs.io/e/`**cd783e4f-f498-4cfc-bc8b-1201bde4726a**
  Server URL for Dynatrace Managed
  `https://{your-domain}/e/{your-environment-id}/api`

### Install Dynatrace OneAgent site extension via Azure Portal
- In Azure Portal, go to the **Weather-Service** App Service
- In the left menu, scroll down to **Development Tools** > **Extensions**
- Select Add, Select Choose extension
- Select Dynatrace OneAgent
- Select Accept legal terms and then select OK to accept the legal terms
- Select OK to add the extension
- Select Dynatrace OneAgent
- Select Browse
- On the Start monitoring your App Service instance page, enter your environment ID, your API token, and your server URL
- Select Install OneAgent
- After installation is complete, go to Azure Portal and **restart** or **stop followed by start** the App Service application to recycle the application's worker process
- Access the webapp's URL again and fire a few transactions

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Automated observability for APIs
Duration: 5

### Validating technology stacks
- Access Dynatrace UI, left hand menu > **Technology**
- As you can see, Dynatrace automatically detects both ASP.NET and the NodeJS components
  ![Dynatrace-weather-service](assets/bootcamp/azure/Dynatrace-weather-service-tech.png)
- Go to **Transactions and Services**, you should see 4 services, 2 are of the .NET technology and another 2, the NodeJS technology 
  ![Dynatrace-weather-service](assets/bootcamp/azure/Dynatrace-weather-service-serviceview.png)
  
Positive
: Can you tell the relationship between the .NET and NodeJS services?
: How do you see graphically which service calls which service?

### Investigate the PurePaths
- Deep dive into some of the PurePaths
  ![Dynatrace-weather-service](assets/bootcamp/azure/Dynatrace-weather-service-pp.gif)

Positive
: What do you notice of the response times of some of the transactions?
: What other components were called?
: Did you have to do any instrumentation to get this visibility?


<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Deploy Weather Express Web App
Duration: 15

### Deploy Weather Express WebApp

Navigate to weather-express folder with `cd ../weather-express` command

Negative
: Similar to the previous step, you may change the **$location** value within the **publish.p1** to fit your region. Full list of regions are [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/global-infrastructure/geographies/#geographies)

```bash  
$resourceGroupName=$args[0]
$webappname=$args[1]
$location="Australia East"
```

Replace the **firstname-lastname** from the below command and adapt that to your own.

`./publish.ps1 firstname-lastname-dynatrace firstname-lastname-weather-express`

**Example**

**./publish.ps1 brandon-neo-dynatrace brandon-neo-weather-express**

Enter **Y** when prompted to deploy the content of the Weather Service app (**AzureWebService/weather-service/weather-express-app.zip**)

### Verify Resource Group creation

Similar to the **Weather Service App** verfication, check on the **Weather Express App** App Service URL. Is it working?

### Debugging 

Within the **Weather Express** App Service, go to the **Advanced Tools** under Deployment Tools.

Within the Kudu page, dropdown Debug Console to **CMD** and go to `site/LogFiles/Application`

Edit `logging-errors.txt` and you can find the error message with the problem

![Azure-shell](assets/bootcamp/azure/debugging.gif)

### Resolution and Verification

Go to **App Service Editor (Preview)** and under `WWWROOT/config/main.js`, resolve the following based on the GIF

- Removing "-" at the last line
- Renaming your Uri to your **firstname-lastname**-weather-service.azurewebsites.net/weather

![Azure-shell](assets/bootcamp/azure/debugging-2.gif)

Once you have resolved the issue, you should be able to access your **Weather Express Portal** 

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Instrumenting Web Apps
Duration: 15

### Leveraging Site Extensions

Deployment the OneAgents cross both **Weather Express App** and **Weather Service Apps**
