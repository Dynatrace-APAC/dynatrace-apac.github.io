### Install Helm 3 and above

OneAgent Operator could be installed via various kubernetes deployment strategies. Following instructions from the UI, we will first setup Helm 3.  

Use the following command to install Helm 3. When prompted, enter your **admin password** which is found in the welcome email. 

`sudo snap install helm --classic`

### Get API and PaaS Tokens in Dynatrace
Follow the steps on screen to create your API and PaaS tokens. 
You will find the API token automatically configured with the necessary permissions. 
Once created, select the **newly created tokens** from both of the **drop-down fields**.
Other commands will also be pre-populated with the necessary steps.

![k8s-setup](assets/k8s/api-paas-ui.gif)

### Add the OneAgent Helm Repo
Follow the setup steps and run the following commands. 

```bash
helm repo add dynatrace https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dynatrace/helm-charts/master/repos/stable
kubectl create namespace dynatrace
```
### Create a and apply values.yaml

Run the below command to create new file called **values.yaml**

`nano values.yaml`

Copy and paste in content in your Dyntrace tenant and save the file with **Ctrl-X** followed by **Y** and **Enter** 

**EXAMPLE**

```bash
platform: "kubernetes"

oneagent:
  name: "oneagent"
  apiUrl: "https://mou612.managed-sprint.dynalabs.io/e/<ENVIRONMENT ID>/api"
  args:
    - --set-app-log-content-access=true
  skipCertCheck: false
  enableIstio: true

secret:
  apiToken: "<API KEY>"
  paasToken: "<PAAS KEY>"
```
Copy the next command to **apply the values.yaml** and **deploy OneAgent on Kubernetes**.

```bash
helm install dynatrace-oneagent-operator \
dynatrace/dynatrace-oneagent-operator -n\
dynatrace --values values.yaml
```
If successful, you should get a positive output with **STATUS: deployed** as per below.

```bash

`kubectl delete --all pods -n dynatrace`

Negative
: Official troubleshooting page could be found [here](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/technology-support/cloud-platforms/google-cloud-platform/google-kubernetes-engine/installation-and-operation/full-stack/troubleshoot-oneagent-on-google-kubernetes-engine/)

If everything is working, you will see the host appearing when you click on **Show Deployment status**

### Restart Sockshop Sample App

You can see the various processes automatically detected but Dynatrace prompts you to restart them. This is required for us to automatically instrument them without code changes.

Run the below command to cycle through your services for **Dev** and **Production**.

```bash
kubectl delete pods --all -n dev
kubectl delete pods --all -n production
```

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Setting up your Kubernetes Integration
Duration: 15

Positive
: As per the official instructions [here](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/technology-support/cloud-platforms/kubernetes/monitoring/connect-kubernetes-clusters-to-dynatrace/) for the Kubernetes integration, you will need to setup an **Environment Activegate** first.

### Setup Activegate 
- Within Dynatrace, click on **Deploy Dynatrace** on the left menu
- Click on **Install Activegate** at the bottom of the page
- Click on **Linux**
- Copy **Step 2** and paste into your shell terminal.
- Copy **Step 4** and append "**sudo**" (installing as root) onto shell terminal. 
When prompted, enter your **admin password** which is found in the welcome email. 

![Copy-AG-Commands](assets/k8s/activegate-2.png)

Once completed, you should see Activegate under **Deployment Status**.

![Activegate-connected](assets/k8s/Picture9.1.png)

### Setup the K8S Overview Dashboard

Go to **Settings -> Process and Containers -> Process group detection -> Enable Cloud Application and workload detection**

![Enable Cloud Workload](assets/k8s/enablecloud.png)

### Create a Service Account and Cluster role

Create a service account and cluster role for accessing the Kubernetes API. This creates the bearer token necessary to authenticate in the Kubernetes API. Use the following snippet in your shell terminal.

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/codefiles/kubernetes/kubernetes-monitoring-service-account.yaml
```
### Setup your Kubernetes Integration

Go to **Settings -> Cloud and Virtualization -> Kubernetes -> Connect new cluster**

### Get the Kubernetes API URL

Enter the below command and copy it for the **Kubernetes API URL**.

```bash
kubectl get ing k8-api-ingress | grep -oP 'api.kubernetes[^[:blank:]]*'
```

### Get the Bearer Token

Enter the below command and copy it for the **Kubernetes Bearer Token**.

```bash
kubectl get secret $(kubectl get sa dynatrace-monitoring -o jsonpath='{.secrets[0].name}' -n dynatrace) -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' -n dynatrace | base64 --decode &
```

![K8S-integration](assets/k8s/activegate-4.png)

- Give a name for the connection eg. **Kubernetes**
- Enter in your **Kubernetes API URL Target**
   - Append **https://** before your API URL
- Enter in the **Kubernetes Bearer Token**
- **Disable** "Require valid certificates for communication with API server"
- **Add** another event field selector
- Use `Non-node` for the field selector name
- Use `involvedObject.kind!=Node` for the Field selector expression and **Save**
- Toggle ON **Monitor Events**
- Click on **Connect**

Once successfully connected, click on Kubernetes on the left menu and explore the Kubernetes UI. 

![K8S-integration](assets/k8s/k8s.png)

Positive
: The above steps are taken from our [offical documentation page](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/technology-support/cloud-platforms/kubernetes/installation-and-operation/further-integrations/connect-your-kubernetes-clusters-to-dynatrace/). We have adapted the API command for lab purposes.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Kubernetes Labels and Annotations
Duration: 5

With the Sockshop app restarted, you should be able to see services in Dynatrace.

Referring to `~/dtacmworkshop/manifests/sockshop-app/production/front-end.yml`, we will want to setup Dynatrace to automatically pick up the annotations and labels

```bash
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: front-end.stable
  namespace: production
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        sidecar.istio.io/inject: "false"
        dynatrace/instrument: "true"
        pipeline.stage: prod-stable
        pipeline.build: 1.4.0.7424
        pipeline.project: sockshop
        support.contact: "jane.smith@sockshop.com"
        support.channel: "#support-sockshop-frontend"
      labels:
        app: front-end.stable
        stage: prod
        release: stable
        version: "1.4"
        tier: "frontend"
        product: "sockshop"
```
### Viewership role for service accounts

The OneAgent will use a pod service account to query for its metadata via the Kubernetes REST API.
The service accounts must be granted **viewer role** in order to have access
In the CLI, execute the following command for the **production project**

```bash
kubectl create rolebinding serviceaccounts-view --clusterrole=view --group=system:serviceaccounts:production --namespace=production
```

You can repeat the procedure for the **dev project**

```bash
kubectl create rolebinding serviceaccounts-view --clusterrole=view --group=system:serviceaccounts:dev --namespace=dev
```

Wait for the Dynatrace to pickup the change. 

Negative
: ⚠️ To manually recycle the apps, run command below.
`wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dynatrace-APAC/Workshop-Kubernetes/master/recycle-sockshop-frontend.sh | bash`

### Validate

Once working, you can validate the change in Dynatrace

: The above steps are taken from [our official documentation page](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/technology-support/cloud-platforms/kubernetes/other-deployments-and-configurations/leverage-tags-defined-in-kubernetes-deployments/)

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Container Environment Variables
Duration: 5

### Adding Environment variables

In shell terminal, add some Environment Variables with the following command

`nano ~/dtacmworkshop/manifests/sockshop-app/production/front-end.yml`

**Make sure that the indentation is correct and that they aren't any error promptings**

```bash
        env:
        - name: DT_TAGS
          value: "product=sockshop"
        - name: DT_CUSTOM_PROP
          value: "SERVICE_TYPE=FRONTEND"
```
![JSON](assets/k8s/Picture13.png)

Save the amended file with **Ctrl-X**, followed by **Y** and **Enter** and run the below command to re-apply the change.

```bash
kubectl apply -f ~/dtacmworkshop/manifests/sockshop-app/production/front-end.yml
wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dynatrace-APAC/Workshop-Kubernetes/master/recycle-sockshop-frontend.sh | bash
```

### Validate

## (Optional) Process Detection for Canary Deployment 
Duration: 15

### Deploy the Canary Release 

Run the command below to trigger the canary release
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dynatrace-APAC/Workshop-Kubernetes/master/manifests/sockshop-app/canary/front-end-canary.yml
```

Execute `kubectl get pods -n production -o wide` and you will see you now have both **stable and canary releases running for the front-end service**

![JSON](assets/k8s/Picture21.png)

Wait 1-2 minutes then look the Services in Dynatrace. You have **2 services in production**, one for **stable** and one for **canary** release.
For monitoring purposes, it should be the same service

![JSON](assets/k8s/Picture22.png)

### Process Detection Rule Config

In the Dynatrace console, go in **Settings -> Processes and containers -> Process group detection**.

Expand the **Cloud application and workload detection** section. 

As per our [documentation](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/how-to-use-dynatrace/process-groups/configuration/adapt-the-composition-of-default-process-groups/#cloud-applications-and-workload-detection), you will need to use the **disable Cloud application and workload detection** while **enabling the rule based tag feature** with `DT-ContainerBoundariesAffected` to select the process groups. 

![Disable-cloud-apps](assets/k8s/disable-cloud-workload.png)

Expand the **Process group detection rules** section. 

Click **Add detection** rule.

Select Use a **process property** to seperate processes

![JSON](assets/k8s/Picture23.png)

We want to apply this rule for pods running in **production only (namespace=production)**

Also, extract the identifier after the **"."** in the pod name. 
Remember the pod names have **".stable "or ".canary"** in their name to distinguish them

![JSON](assets/k8s/Picture24.png)

Run the below command to **recycle both stable and canary frontend pods**. The process detection rules are applied on process startup.

```bash
wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dynatrace-APAC/Workshop-Kubernetes/master/recycle-sockshop-frontend.sh | bash
```

Within Dynatrace, you can see that the Process Groups have been merged.

![Process-Group-Merged](assets/k8s/Picture24.1.png)

The services are still detected as individual services and can be merged as well.

Go to **Settings -> Merge Service monitoring -> Create merged service**

![Service-Merged](assets/k8s/Picture24.2.png)

### Validate

![JSON](assets/k8s/Picture25.png)

With the services merged as one, you can now view monitor Stable vs Canary response

Create Multi-dimensional Analysis view by selecting **Create Chart**

![JSON](assets/k8s/Picture26.png)

Choose **Response Time - Server** and select **Service Instance** as Dimension Splitting

![JSON](assets/k8s/Picture27.png)
