# Dynatrace with Kubernetes on GKE
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Introduction 
Duration: 1

This repository contains labs for the Hands-On Kubernetes Session. We will be using Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) for this hands-on but this will work on other PaaS platforms as well.

For the purposes of the Hands-On, we will automate and make the steps seamless for the participants

### Prerequisites
- Dynatrace SaaS/Managed Account. Get your free SaaS trial here.
- Google Cloud account with access to GKE. Get your free trial access here.
- Chrome Browser

### What Youâ€™ll Learn 
- Deploying Dynatrace Operator via Helm Chart on Kubernetes
- Setup Kubernetes integration on Dynatrace
- Enabling early access feature flags in Dynatrace
- Discover Kubernetes View on Dynatrace

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Setting up your Google Kubernetes Environment (GKE)
Duration: 5

### Sign up for a Google Cloud Platform Account

Head over to https://cloud.google.com/free/ and sign up for a free GCP account with your existing Google account. 

You can also signup for a new Google Account if you don't have one

Upon signup, you will have free credits tied to your GCP account. (12 months + 400AUD)

You can login to your GCP console [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/).

### Enable Kubernetes Engine API 

You will also need to **Enable your API Billing** with Kubernetes Engine API. 

![k8s-Engine](assets/k8s/Picture3.png)

You should be prompted to the billing page while setting up your GKE instance. 

If not, you can follow the steps [here](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158867?hl=en)

### Activate Cloud Shell

![GKE-Menu](assets/k8s/Picture4.png)

Click on the Terminal Icon on the top right

A Cloud based Terminal lookalike will appear at the bottom of the page

We will start setting up our GKE Cluster 

### 3. Create your GKE Cluster

![GKE-CLI](assets/k8s/Picture5.png)

Create your GKE cluster named **k8sworkshop** running Ubuntu in GKE with the following command.
We will also be creating a compute VM for a Dynatrace Activegate. We will use the Dynatrace Activegate for Kubernetes integration.

```bash
gcloud container clusters create k8sworkshop --image-type=ubuntu --zone australia-southeast1-a
gcloud compute instances create dynatrace-activegate --image-family ubuntu-1604-lts --image-project ubuntu-os-cloud --zone australia-southeast1-a
```

Once completed, you will have a running GKE Cluster!

Automating the steps from our offical [documentation page](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/technology-support/cloud-platforms/kubernetes/installation-and-operation/further-integrations/connect-your-kubernetes-clusters-to-dynatrace/), we provided the API URL and bearer token automatically via API. Back in your main Cloud Shell terminal, enter the below

``` bash
wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dynatrace-APAC/Workshop-Kubernetes/master/setup-k8s-ui.sh | bash
```
With the above results, enter the values to **Settings** -> **Cloud and Virtualization** -> **Kubernetes**

## Exploring Dynatrace
Duration: 5

### Automatic Discovery of services

In Dynatrace, go to Transactions and Services to see the automatic 5 discovered services.
![Discovered Services](assets/k8s/lab5-autodiscoveredservices.png)

You will realized that some services are discovered but some might not match <a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo#service-architecture">Hipster Shop's Service architecture</a>.
Hipster Shop uses cutting edge technologies (such as GPRC) which Dynatrace supports with the constant evolution in the cloud.

![Architecture](assets/k8s/architecture-diagram.png)

### Enabling additional features within OneAgent

Because of the rapid rate of change coming to OneAgent, features that are in Early Access aren't automatically enabled by default. 
This is to prevent unforseen circumstances which might impact your production environments. For the purposes of workshop, we can enable these features. Go to **Settings -> Service-side service monitoring -> Deep Monitoring -> New Oneagent Features**

Under Global Settings, enable the following feature flags. They are on different pages so you would need to toggle through the pages.

You can use the search filter bar to search for **"GRPC"**
![GRPC-Features](assets/k8s/lab5-b4EnableGRPC-settings.png )

![Features](assets/k8s/features.png)

Make sure all the below features all enabled, including the 2 additional NodeJS feature flags.
![All-Features](assets/k8s/all-features.png)

Enabling OneAgents features requires a restart of the pods. Run the following command to restart the pods.

```bash
kubectl delete pods --all -n hipster-shop
```
![Restart](assets/k8s/restart.png)

Back in Dynatrace, go to and Transactions and Services to see the updated list of services.
![Discovered Services](assets/k8s/lab5-AfterEnableGRPC-settings.png)

Clicking on Go Service ":8080" followed by Service Flow, you can see that the service are automatically detected and matches the architecture diagram above.

![Service Flow](assets/k8s/serviceflow.png)
